            <h4>Welcome, and thanks for helping us to test the new Phamerator!</h4>
            <p>You are using Phamerator, a comparative viral genomics platform developed for HHMI's SEA-PHAGES program.
                Phamerator is written by the Steven Cresawn lab in James Madison
                University's Department of Biology. Bug reports are welcome and can be submitted via
                <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/scresawn/phamerator/issues">GitHub</a>.
                Pull requests are also encouraged.
            </p>

            <p>Here are a few tips to get you started!</p>

                  <i class="material-icons">web</i> De-constructing the phamerator 2.0
                </div>
                <div class="collapsible-body">
                  <p> The basic layout of phamerator 2.0 is just that - basic. We've tried to design it so that anybody
                      can use it intuitively. However, there's always that one person (sometimes me) who can't always
                      see what others think is obvious, and what others think is obvious, is actually humanly
                      impossible. So, for starters, when you first enter the address into the bar (or open the app from
                      your phone), you should arrive at this page. To your left (or if you swipe left) you will see a
                      selection of different tabs titled Home, Phages, Phamilies, Domains, and Account. You are able to
                      select your own profile picture for your account, but that will be covered more in "A guide to the
                      basics" below. To switch to a different page in the app, simply select the tab on the left that
                      you wish to view. You should be taken to that section after. If you have any complaints, please
                      feel free to send them via the GitHub link above (please remember that we are people too, so keep
                      your complaints civil.)</p>

                  <p>Phamerator has a secure accounts system which will be used to save your preferences and other
                      information, allowing you to switch between multiple computers or even mobile apps (coming soon)
                      without losing track of your work. While you don't need an account to use Phamerator, having
                      one makes things better.</p>

                <p>To find and select phage(s) to make a genome map, select <i>Genome Maps</i> on the left
                    hand of the screen (if using the web app) or swipe left-to-right to access the menu. Once there, you
                    will see two tabs: <i>Select phages</i> and <i>View Map</i>. If you stay on the "Select Phages"
                    sections, you will see a list of phage phamilies. To select an entire phamily, check the box beside
                    the phamily name. If you would like to select a single phage, or phages from many different
                    phamilies, then click on the white space beside the phamily name. Thiswill trigger a drop-down menu
                    that has a list of all phages in that phamily that are in our database. To select your desired
                    phage, just click the box next to it.  </p>

                            takes a couple of seconds, Rome wasn't built in a day. Should you decide to order your
                            phages in a different manner, you can select the teal hamburger menu at the bottom right of
                            the screen. This will give you several other buttons, one of which being a yellow "settings"
                            button. Click this, and you will see the settings screen pop up in the middle of the screen.
                            Feel free to play around and select the order buttons that you want. </p>

                            "download" button. This will save your map as an svg onto your computer. You can right-click
                            the download at the bottom of your screen to re-name the file or move it into another
                            folder. If you wish to view the svg on your computer immediately, you can click the
                            download, and it will pop up in a new window. Your image should be scalable, easy to read,
                            and most importantly, easy to use. </p>
