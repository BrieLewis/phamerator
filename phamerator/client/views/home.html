            <p>You are using an alpha version of Phamerator, written by the Steven Cresawn lab in James Madison University's Department of Biology. Bug reports are welcome
                and can be submitted via <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/scresawn/phamerator/issues">GitHub</a>.

                  <p>Hello, and thank you so much for trying the new phamerator, phamerator 2.0! To access the information in this cheat sheet, just do as this drop-down's title, and CLICK! If, while you are learning how to use this software, you wish there had been another topic discussed in the cheat sheet, please feel free to send a report to the GitHub link above. Happy learning!</p>

                <div class="collapsible-body">
                  <p> The basic layout of phamerator 2.0 is just that - basic. We've tried to design it so that anybody can use it intuitively. However, there's always that one person (sometimes me) who can't always see what others think is obvious, and what others think is obvious, is actually humanly impossible. So, for starters, when you first enter the address into the bar (or open the app from your phone), you should arrive at this page. To your left (or if you swipe left) you will see a selection of different tabs titled Home, Phages, Phamilies, Domains, and Account. You are able to select your own profile picture for your account, but that will be covered more in "A guide to the basics" below. To switch to a different page in the app, simply select the tab on the left that you wish to view. You should be taken to that section after. If you have any complaints, please feel free to send them via the GitHub link above (please remember that we are people too, so keep your complaints civil.)</p>

                  <p>In order to enjoy the full benefits that phamerator 2.0 offers, you kind of need an account. Look to the left of your screen, and you will see the list of tabs that were discussed in the previous pulldown. At the very bottom of this section is the "Account" tab. Once clicked, it will bring you to a page that has the account information (i.e. username and password). At the very bottom of this window is a blue Register option. Select this button, and enter your VALID email address, password (which are case-sensitive, and must match or else  you won't be able to register), and desired username. Once everything is to your liking on that page, click the teal button that says "Register". A confirmation email will be sent to the email address that you provided. That is, unless you forgot about putting a VALID email (this means NOT the junk one you use to sign into social media accounts and forget about three years later). Once you follow all of the steps in the confirmation email, you are free to paruse the complete world of phamerator 2.0! </p>

                </div>
                <div class="collapsible-body">
                <p>To find and select a phage/phages/phamilies to make a genome map, select the "Phages" tab on the left hand of the screen (if using the web-app) or swipe left to bring the menu out. Once in that tab, you will see two sections, one of which is titled "Select Phages" and the other is "View Map". If you stay on the "Select Phages" sections, you will see a list of phage phamilies. To select an entier phamily, check the box beside the phamily  name. If you would like to select a single phage, or phages from many different phamilies, then click on the white space beside the phamily name. This will trigger a drop-down menu that has a list of all phages in that phamily that are in our database. To select your desired phage, just click the box next to it.  </p>

      					<p>Once you have all of your desired phages selected, you can click the "View Map" section, and see your selected phages' genome maps pop up! Please don't be alarmed if you notice that it takes a couple of seconds, Rome wasn't built in a day. Should you decide to order your phages in a different manner, you can select the teal hamburger menu at the bottom right of the screen. This will give you several other buttons, one of which being a yellow "settings" button. Click this, and you will see the settings screen pop up in the middle of the screen. Feel free to play around and select the order buttons that you want. </p>

      					<p>Once all of your phages are selected and organized in a manner that makes sense, you can click on the teal hamburger menu on the bottom right of the screen and select the purple "download" button. This will save your map as an svg onto your computer. You can right-click the download at the bottom of your screen to re-name the file or move it into another folder. If you wish to view the svg on your computer immediately, you can click the download, and it will pop up in a new window. Your image should be scalable, easy to read, and most importantly, easy to use. </p>
