            <h3>Welcome, and thanks for helping us to test the new Phamerator!</h3>
            <p>You are using an alpha version of Phamerator, written by the Steven Cresawn lab in James Madison University's Department of Biology. Bug reports are welcome
                and can be submitted via <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/scresawn/phamerator/issues">GitHub</a>.

            <p>Phamerator: Comparative Genomics for HHMI's SEA-PHAGES program</p>

            <h4>Here's a small cheat sheet to get you started!</h4>

      					<i class="material-icons">filter_drama</i>Finding and Selecting phages/phamilies to add to your genome map
      				</div>
      				<div class="collapsible-body">
      					<p>To find and select a phage/phages/phamilies to make a genome map, select the "Phages" tab on the left hand of the screen (if using the web-app) or swipe left to bring the menu out. Once in that tab, you will see two sections, one of which is titled "Select Phages" and the other is "View Map". If you stay on the "Select Phages" sections, you will see a list of phage phamilies. To select an entier phamily, check the box beside the phamily  name. If you would like to select a single phage, or phages from many different phamilies, then click on the white space beside the phamily name. This will trigger a drop-down menu that has a list of all phages in that phamily that are in our database. To select your desired phage, just click the box next to it.  </p>

      					<p>Once you have all of your desired phages selected, you can click the "View Map" section, and see your selected phages' genome maps pop up! Please don't be alarmed if you notice that it takes a couple of seconds, Rome wasn't built in a day. Should you decide to order your phages in a different manner, you can select the teal hamburger menu at the bottom right of the screen. This will give you several other buttons, one of which being a yellow "settings" button. Click this, and you will see the settings screen pop up in the middle of the screen. Feel free to play around and select the order buttons that you want. </p>

      					<p>Once all of your phages are selected and organized in a manner that makes sense, you can click on the teal hamburger menu on the bottom right of the screen and select the purple "download" button. This will save your map as an svg onto your computer. You can right-click the download at the bottom of your screen to re-name the file or move it into another folder. If you wish to view the svg on your computer immediately, you can click the download, and it will pop up in a new window. Your image should be scalable, easy to read, and most importantly, easy to use. </p>
